# RMarkdown

RMarkdown is a combination of two tools: Markdown is a simple way of writing
plain text that can be formatted into fancy documents. Markdown originated
as a tool for easily writing blog posts and comments that include formatting,
such as section  headings, italic and bold-faced text, and so forth without
having to learn a technical formatting language, such as HTML. Markdown is 
fairly generic, so it is easy to translate a single Markdown document into
many output formats, such as HTML for web pages,  PDF, and Microsoft Word documents.

You can learn a lot about the details of Markdown at the RStudio web site 
<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. RStudio has a handy cheat sheet for RMarkdown 
that you can see by opening the Help menu, going to "Cheatsheets" and
opening the RMarkdown Cheat Sheet or the more comprehensive RMarkdown Reference.

What makes RMarkdown different from ordinary Markdown is that it allows you to 
combine text, formatted in Markdown, with instructions to the R statistical 
software to analyze data and produce graphs, tables, and other useful output.

By integrating the data analysis with the text of a document, we can easily make our 
research reproducible. The RMarkdown file contains all the instructions to 
load the data, analyze it, and generate the final report. Then if your
data changes and you need to update your report, you can do so by knitting the
RMarkdown document with the updated data files.

To turn an RMarkdown document into an HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word document, you 
just click on the "Knit" button in RStudio. If you click on the word "Knit" on the 
button, RStudio will turn the RMarkdown document into the default format (see 
below). To knit the document into a different output format, click on the arrow 
just to the right of the word "Knit," and select the output format you want.

I use RMarkdown to produce all of the documents I produce for the labs in this course.
You can see my code at <https://github.com/gilligan-ees-3310-2018>.
The code for all of the Lab #1 documentation is at 
<https://github.com/gilligan-ees-3310-2018/lab_01_documentation>

# Document header

At the top of an RMarkdown document there is a section set off by lines of three
hyphens above it and below it.

Here is an example:

```
---
title: "Your document's title"
subtitle: "Your document's subtitle"
author: "Your name goes here"
date: "Aug 28, 2017"
output:
    pdf_document: default
    html_document: default
---
```

By default, when RStudio knits the document, it converts it into the format listed
first under `output_format`

When the output format lists, for instance, "`pdf_format: default`", that means
that when RStudio creates a pdf document, it uses the default options. 
If you want to customize the output, you can specify
options for RStudio to use in creating PDF, HTML, or Word output documents:

```
---
title: "Your document's title"
subtitle: "Your document's subtitle"
author: "Your name goes here"
date: "Aug 28, 2017"
output:
    pdf_document:
      toc: "true" 
      number_sections: "false"
    html_document:
      self_contained: "false"
---
```



# Markdown 

Some of the basic elements of Markdown are:

## Paragraphs

Any block of one or more lines of text, with a blank line before and a blank line after
is treated as a single paragraph.  To separate paragraphs, put a blank line between them:

### Markdown:

```
This is one paragraph.
It stretches over several consecutive lines,
but it will be formatted 
as a single paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
The blank line between the two
blocks of text tells Markdown
that they are separate paragraphs
```

### Formatted Output:

> This is one paragraph.
It stretches over several consecutive lines,
but it will be formatted 
as a single paragraph.
>
> This is another paragraph.
The blank line between the two
blocks of text tells Markdown
that they are separate paragraphs

## Section headers

Any line of text that begins with one or more hash symbols ("#") and is preceded by 
a blank line is treated as a section header. Top-level section headers have a single
hash, and subsections, subsubsections, etc. use two, three, etc. hashes.

### Markdown:

```
# This is a top-level section header

## This is a subsection

### This is a subsubsection

# This is another section
```

### Formatted Output: 

```

```

> # This is a top-level section header
>
> ## This is a subsection
>
> ### This is a subsubsection
>
> # This is another section

## Formatting text

To make _italic text_ and **boldface text** you surround the text with underscores 
or asterisks. A single underscore or asterisk means italic, two means boldface, 
and three means both italic and boldface:

### Markdown:

```
This is _italic text_. This is *also italic text*. __This is boldface__ and 
**so is this**. ***This is bold italic***. This is ~~strikethrough~~, perhaps 
to indicate an error.
```

### Formatted Output:

> This is _italic text_. This is *also italic text*. __This is boldface__ and 
> **so is this**. ***This is bold italic***. This is ~~strikethrough~~, perhaps 
> to indicate an error.


## Lists

You can make bulleted or numbered lists easily in Markdown. Simply begin a line 
with an asterisk, hyphen, or plus sign.
To make a sub-list, just indent the lines of the sublist by four spaces.

### Markdown:

```
* This is a list

* This is the second item of the list.

    * This is a sub-list

    * This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs. Just ident the continuation 
        by four additional spaces and do not begin it with an asterisk.
        If you have multiple lines with no blank line separating them,
        Markdown treats them as a single paragraph.

        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.

* This is the main list again.
  Just as with other things, you can break a single list item into several lines,
  and as long as there is no blank line between them, Markdown knows to treat
  them as a single paragraph.
```

### Formatted Output:

* This is a list

* This is the second item of the list.

    * This is a sub-list

    * This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs. Just indent the continuation 
        by four additional spaces and do not begin it with an asterisk.
        If you have multiple lines with no blank line separating them,
        Markdown treats them as a single paragraph.
        
        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.

* This is the main list again.
  Just as with other things, you can break a single list item into several lines,
  and as long as there is no blank line between them, Markdown knows to treat
  them as a single paragraph.

## Numbered Lists

To make numbered lists, start them with a number and a period:

### Markdown

```
1. This is a list

1. This is the second item of the list. Notice that I keep using the 
   numeral "1", but Markdown automatically increments the numbers
   for the list items.

    a) This is a sub-list

    a) This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs.
        
        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.
        
        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

1. This is the main list again.

```

### Formatted Output:

1.  This is a list

1.  This is the second item of the list. Notice that I keep using the 
   numeral "1", but Markdown automatically increments the numbers
   for the list items.

    a)  This is a sub-list

    a)  This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs.
        
        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.
        
        i)  this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

        i)  this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

        i)  this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

1.  This is the main list again.


## Mathematical expressions

For simple math, you can just type stuff in  RMarkdown: `1 + 2 * 3` comes out as 
1 + 2 * 3.  If you want subscripts or superscripts, you can get those by using 
the `~` and `^` characters, respectively: `I~out~ = sigma T^4^` appears as 
I~out~ = sigma T^4^.

If you want fancier formatting for mathematical expressions, RMarkdown has a way 
to do this.

If you put an expression between dollar signs, RMarkdown interprets it differently 
from regular RMarkdown, and uses a format called LaTeX that is used for typesetting
sophisticated mathematics. I won't try to present all of LaTeX here, but will give 
some common examples:

An expression between single dollar signs is interpreted as _in-line_ math that
appears in the middle of a line of text. LaTeX uses special terms that begin with
a backslash `\` to indicate special mathematical formatting or operators.
For example `$a + b \times x$` appears
as $a  + b \times x$. 

You can show Greek letters, like $\alpha$, $\pi$, and $\sigma$ by spelling them 
out like this: `$\alpha$`, `$\pi$`, and `$\sigma$`. The epsilon that we use to 
indicate emissivity is a variation on the ordinary Greek epsilon, so we spell it
`$\varepsilon$` to get $\varepsilon$.

LaTeX handles subscripts and superscripts differently from RMarkdown:
You use `_{}` and `^{}` with whatever you want to appear in the subscript 
or superscript inside the braces `{}`:
`$I_{out} = \sigma T^{4}$` appears as $I_{out} = \sigma T^{4}$

You can include square root signs using `\sqrt`: `$x = \sqrt{y \times z}$` appears
as $x = \sqrt{y \times z}$. You can do other roots like this: 
`$T = \sqrt[4]{I_{out} / \sigma}$` appears as $T = \sqrt[4]{I_{out} / \sigma}$.

To get display math, which appears on its own line, you use double dollar signs. 
This is useful when you want to write a mathematical expression that is much taller 
than a line of text. In display mode you can display fractions using 
`\frac{numerator expression}{denominator expression}`, as in this example:
`$$\varepsilon \sigma T^4 = \frac{(1 - \alpha)}{4} \times I_{solar}$$` appears as

$$ \varepsilon \sigma T^4 = \frac{(1 - \alpha)}{4} \times I_{solar}$$
`$$T_{bare rock} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha)}{4 \varepsilon \sigma} \times I_{solar}}$$`
appears as

$$T_{bare rock} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha)}{4 \varepsilon \sigma} \times I_{solar}}$$

There is a lot more to the LaTeX notation that you can use in 
RMarkdown, but what I have shown here is sufficient for everything you will 
do in this class.
You won't need to use this kind of mathematical notation very much, but it can 
be convenient, especially when you are working exercises on atmospheric layer 
models.

If you find it too difficult to use LaTeX mathematical notation, I will accept 
either hand-written supplements in which you write out the equations by hand, or
a textual description in your document where you use words instead of mathematical
symbols to explain what you are doing.

## Figures

You can include image files in your RMarkdown document:

### Markdown

```
![This is a tornado](images/tornado.jpg)
```

### Formatted Output:

![This is a tornado](images/tornado.jpg)

## Hyperlinks

You can include links to documents on the web in two ways. The simplest
is if you want the URL for the link to appear in your document you can just 
surround the URL with angle brackets:
`<https://www.vanderbilt.edu>` appears as <https://www.vanderbilt.edu>. 

If you want to add a hyperlink to some text in your document, then you would
do it like this:

```
[Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu)
``` 

to get this: [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu).

Note the difference between the hyperlink specification and the image specification
is whether there is an exclamation point before the square brackets.

# Using R for calculations

RMarkdown combines the "Markdown" system for formatting text with the
R statistical system for performing calculations and making graphs.

We are using R for the laboratory section of this course because it allows you to 
easily analyze large amounts of data and produce high-quality graphs.

To enter R expressions in an RMarkdown document, we use "code blocks" and
"inline code". Code blocks are useful if we are doing a calculation, and 
inline code is useful if you just want to insert a number (maybe one you have
calculated in a code block) into the middle of a line of text.

Code blocks begin and end with three consecutive "back-tick" characters:

<pre><code>```{r code_block_name, options}
   # code goes here
```</code></pre>

Inline code appears between single back-ticks: `r rinline("code goes here")`

We express basic mathematical operations in R similarly to the way we express them 
in Excel and most programming languages. Addition and subtraction use the
normal plus and minus signs. Multiplication uses an asterisk, division uses
a slash ("/"), and powers (exponentiation) uses "^".

R has a lot of mathematical functions you can use, such as `sqrt()`, `log()` 
(for the natural logarithm), `log10()` for the base-10 logarithm, and so forth.

We can assign numbers to variables using the equals sign:
```{r stefan_boltzmann}
sigma = 5.67E-8
I_solar = 1350 # watts per square meter
albedo = 0.3
I_absorbed = I_solar * (1 - albedo)
T = (I_absorbed / (4 * sigma))^0.25
```

If the last line of a code block is something with a value (e.g., the name of a 
variable or a mathematical expression, as opposed to an assignment with an equals 
sign), then R will show that value:

```{r surface_temperature}
T
```


We can also print the value of an R expression in the middle of a line of text 
using inline code: ` T = ` `r rinline("T")` will give T = `r T`.

Inline code is very useful because it lets us ask R to automatically insert a 
number into the text. This means that every time we knit the document, that number 
is generated by R. If you write a report and then realize that there was a problem 
with the data or the analysis, you can just fix the problem and re-knit the report 
using the corrected data and analysis code. You don't need to manually go through 
a separate document and edit the numbers to update them with the latest results 
from your analysis. RMarkdown will do that for you, if you used inline code to 
insert the numbers into your text.

Thus, a bit of extra work at the beginning to set up the document and analysis 
using RMarkdown saves lots of time later on by making it trivial to update the 
document.

Code blocks also allow us to include graphs in our document:


<pre><code>```{r graph_example, fig.cap = "This is a plot of pressure versus temperature."}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Temperature", y = "Pressure")
```</code></pre>


```{r graph_example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "This is a plot of pressure versus temperature."}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Temperature", y = "Pressure")
```

## Loading R Scripts

In this course, I am trying to teach you to use the basics of R. Sometimes we will 
need to do things for our analysis that require more complicated R programming,
and then I will write R scripts that contain this code so you don't need to write
it yourself from scratch, but can just call functions that I provide.

To load a script (a file containing R code), you use the R command 
`source("script_file.R"")`

For the exercises here, we will use two scripts, which are located in the 
"_scripts" directory.

To load them into R so you can use them in your analysis, you would put the 
following code into your RMarkdown document:

```{r load_scripts}
source("_scripts/format_md.R")
source("_scripts/layer_diagram.R")
```

### Useful Scripts for the Labs:

These first script defines a function, `format_md`, which formats 
numbers nicely for markdown documents, allowing you to control how many 
significant digits it shows, and optionally using scientific notation or 
inserting commas to separate thousands, millions, etc.

`format_md(sigma, digits = 1)` will produce `r format_md(sigma, digits = 1)`

`format_md(sigma, digits = 1, scientific = FALSE)` will produce 
`r format_md(sigma, digits = 1, scientific = FALSE)`

`format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE)` will produce 
`r format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE)`

`format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, comma = TRUE)` will produce 
`r format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, comma = TRUE)`

### Script for Layer Diagrams

The other script allows you to produce a layer diagram, similar to the ones in 
Chapter 3 of _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

```{r example_layer_diagram}
make_layer_diagram(2)
```
