Such measurements need a diurnal correction to prevent drifts in the satellites' measurement time from causing spurious trends. We have derived a diurnal correction that, in the tropics, is of the opposite sign from that previously applied. When we use this correction in the calculation of lower tropospheric temperature from satellite microwave measurements, we find tropical warming consistent with that found at the surface and in our satellite-derived version of middle/upper tropospheric temperature.
After modification of an erroneous diurnal correction, a reconstruction of recent atmospheric warming of the lower troposphere from satellite data now agrees with that inferred from measurements at the surface.

At the 29 stations that make both day and night observations, the average nighttime trend (+0.12 K decade−1) is 0.05 K decade−1 more positive than that for the daytime (+0.07 K decade−1) in the unadjusted observations, an unlikely physical possibility indicating adjustments are needed. At the 58 sites the {UAH} data indicate a trend of +0.08 K decade−1, the {RSS} data, +0.15. When the largest discontinuities in the sondes are detected and removed through comparison with {UAH} data, the trend of day and night releases combined becomes +0.09, and using {RSS} data, +0.12. Relative to several data sets, the {RSS} data show a warming shift, broadly occurring in 1992, of between +0.07 K and +0.13 K. Because the shift occurs at the time {NOAA}-12 readings began to be merged into the satellite data stream and large {NOAA}-11 adjustments were applied, the discrepancy appears to be due to bias adjustment procedures. Several comparisons are consistent with a 26-year trend and error estimate for the {UAH} {LT} product for the full tropics of +0.05 ± 0.07, which is very likely less than the tropical surface trend of +0.13 K decade−1.},

Air temperatures measured at the Earth's surface, in contrast, have risen by approximately +0.13 K per decade over the same period,. The two temperature records are derived from measurements of different physical parameters, and thus are not directly comparable. In fact, the lower stratosphere is cooling substantially (by about -0.5 K per decade), so the warming trend seen at the surface is expected to diminish with altitude and change into a cooling trend at some point in the troposphere. Even so, it has been suggested that the cooling trend seen in the satellite data is excessive,,. The difficulty in reconciling the information from these different sources has sparked a debate in the climate community about possible instrumental problems and the existence of global warming,,. Here we identify an artificial cooling trend in the satellite-derived temperature series caused by previously neglected orbital-decay effects. We find a new, corrected estimate of +0.07 K per decade for the {MSU}-based temperature trend, which is in closer agreement with surface temperatures. We also find that the reported cooling of the lower troposphere, relative to the middle troposphere, is another artefact caused by uncorrected orbital-decay effects.},
