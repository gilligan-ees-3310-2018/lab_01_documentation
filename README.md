This repository contains introductory documentation for major concepts and tools 
we will use in the EES 3310/5310 labs:

* You should start with [Reproducible_research](Reproducible_research.pdf),
  which introduces the important concepts of reproducible research, which we
  will be using in this lab section.

* Then you should read about RMarkdown and RStudio in [RMarkdown_intro](RMarkdown_intro.pdf).
  These are the tools we will use for data analysis and producing reports.

* Finally, you should read about revision control in [Git_intro](Git_intro.pdf),
  and you should also check out the introduction by Jenny Bryan to using Git and 
  Github with Rstudio, at the links provided in Git_intro.
