# RMarkdown

RMarkdown is a combination of two tools: Markdown is a simple way of writing
plain text that can be formatted into fancy documents. Markdown originated
as a tool for easily writing blog posts and comments that include formatting,
such as section  headings, italic and bold-faced text, and so forth without
having to learn a technical formatting language, such as HTML. Markdown is 
fairly generic, so it is easy to translate a single Markdown document into
many output formats, such as HTML for web pages,  PDF, and Microsoft Word documents.

You can learn a lot about the details of Markdown at the RStudio web site <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
RStudio has a handy cheat sheet for RMarkdown that you can see by opening the Help menu, going to "Cheatsheets" and
opening the Rmarkdown Cheat Sheet or the more comprehensive RMarkdown Reference.

What makes RMarkdown different from ordinary Markdown is that it allows you to 
combine text, formatted in Markdown, with instructinos to the R statistical 
software to analyze data and produce graphs, tables, and other useful output.

By integrating the data analysis with the text of a document, we can easily make our 
research reproducible. The RMarkdown file contains all the instructions to 
load the data, analyze it, and generate the final report. Then if your
data changes and you need to update your report, you can do so by knitting the
RMarkdown document with the updated data files.

# Markdown 

Some of the basic elements of Markdown are:

## Paragraphs

Any block of one or more lines of text, with a blank line before and a blank line after
is treated as a single paragraph.  To separate paragraphs, put a blank line between them:

```
This is one paragraph.
It stretches over several consecutive lines,
but it will be formatted 
as a single paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
The blank line between the two
blocks of text tells Markdown
that they are separate paragraphs
```

> This is one paragraph.
It stretches over several consecutive lines,
but it will be formatted 
as a single paragraph.
>
> This is another paragraph.
The blank line between the two
blocks of text tells Markdown
that they are separate paragraphs

## Section headers

Any line of text that begins with one or more hash symbols ("#") and is preceded by 
a blank line is treated as a section header. Top-level section headers have a single
hash, and subsections, subsubsections, etc. use two, three, etc. hashes.

```
# This is a top-level section header

## This is a subsection

### This is a subsubsection

# This is another section
```

> # This is a top-level section header
>
> ## This is a subsection
>
> ### This is a subsubsection
>
> # This is another section

## Formatting text

To make _italic text_ and **boldface text** you surround the text with underscores or asterisks. 
A single underscore or asterisk means italic, two means boldface, and three means both italic and boldface:

```
This is _italic text_. This is *also italic text*. __This is boldface__ and **so is this**.
***This is bold italic***. This is ~~strikethrough~~, perhaps to indicate an error.
```

> This is _italic text_. This is *also italic*. __This is boldface__ and **so is this**.
***This is bold italic***. This is ~~strikethrough,~~ perhaps to indicate an error.

## Lists

You can make bulleted or numbered lists easily in Markdown. Simply begin a line with an asterisk, hyphen, or plus sign.
To make a sub-list, just indent the lines of the sublist by four spaces.

```
* This is a list

* This is the second item of the list.

    * This is a sub-list

    * This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs. Just ident the continuation by four additional spaces and do not begin it with an asterisk.
        
        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.

* This is the main list again.
```

* This is a list

* This is the second item of the list.

    * This is a sub-list

    * This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs. Just ident the continuation by four additional spaces and do not begin it with an asterisk.
        
        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.

* This is the main list again.

To make numbered lists, start them with a number and a period:

```
1. This is a list

1. This is the second item of the list. Notice that I keep using the 
   numeral "1", but Markdown automatically increments the numbers
   for the list items.

    a) This is a sub-list

    a) This is another item in the sub-list
    
        A list item can have several paragraphs. Just ident the continuation by four additional spaces and do not begin it with an asterisk.
        
        Here is a third paragraph of continuation.
        
        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

1. This is the main list again.

```

        i) this is a sub-sub list numbered with Roman numerals

1. This is the main list again.


## Mathematical expressions

For simple math, you can just type stuff in  RMarkdon: `1 + 2 * 3` comes out as 1 + 2 * 3. 
If you want subscripts or superscripts, you can get those by using the `~` and `^` characters, respectively:
`I~out~ = sigma T^4^` appears as I~out~ = sigma T^4^.

If you want fancier formatting for mathematical expressions, RMarkdown has a way to do this.
However, it is complicated and I will **not** expect you to learn it for this class.

If you put an expression between dollar signs, RMarkdown interprets it differently 
from regular RMarkdown, and uses a format called LaTeX that is used for typesetting
sophisticated mathematics. I won't try to present all of LaTeX here, but will give some
common examples:

An expression between single dollar signs is interpreted as _in-line_ math that
appears in the middle of a line of text. LaTeX uses special terms that begin with a 
backslash `\` to indicate special mathematical formatting or operators.
For example `$a \times x + b$` appears
as $a \times x + b$. 

LaTeX handles subscripts and superscripts differently from RMarkdown:
You use `_{}` and `^{}` with whatever you want to appear in the subscript 
or superscript inside the curly braces `{}`:
`$I_{out} = \sigma T^{4{$` appears as $I_{out} = \sigma T^{4}$

You can include square root signs using `\sqrt`: `$x = \sqrt{y \times z}$` appears
as $x = \sqrt{y \times z}$. You can do other roots like this: 
`$T = \sqrt[4]{I_{out} / \sigma}$` appears as $T = \sqrt[4]{I_{out} / \sigma}$.

To get display math, which appears on its own line, you use double dollar signs. 
This is useful when you want to write a mathematical expression that is much taller than a line of text:
`$$\varepsilon \sigma T^4 = \frac{(1 - \alpha)}{4} \times I_{solar}$$` appears as

$$ \varepsilon \sigma T^4 = \frac{(1 - \alpha)}{4} \times I_{solar}$$

If this seems too painfully complicated, don't worry. I do not expect you to learn this mathematical
notation and it will not be required for this course. I only mention it in case you are interested.

## Figures

You can include image files in your RMarkdown document:

```

```

# Using R for calculations

RMarkdown combines the "Markdown" system for formatting text with the
R statistical system for performing calculations and making graphs.

We are using R for the laboratory section of this course because it allows you to 
easily analyze large amounts of data and produce high-quality graphs.

To enter R expressions in an RMarkdown document, we use "code blocks" and
"inline code". Code blocks are useful if we are doing a calculation, and 
inline code is useful if you just want to insert a number (maybe one you have
calculated in a code block) into the middle of a line of text.

Code blocks begin and end with three consecutive "back-tick" characters:

<pre><code>```{r code_block_name, options}
   # code goes here
```</code></pre>

Inline code appears between single back-ticks: `r rinline("code goes here")`

We express basic mathematical operations in R similarly to the way we express them 
in Excel and most programming languages. Addition and subtraction use the
normal plus and minus signs. Multiplication uses an asterisk, division uses
a slash ("/"), and powers (exponentiation) uses "^".

R has a lot of mathematical functions you can use, such as `sqrt()`, `log()` (for the natural logarithm),
`log10()` for the base-10 logarithm, and so forth.

We can assign numbers to variables using the equals sign:
```{r stefan_boltzmann}
sigma = 5.67E-8
I_solar = 1350 # watts per square meter
albedo = 0.3
I_absorbed = I_solar * (1 - albedo)
T = (I_absorbed / (4 * sigma))^0.25
```

If the last line of a code block is something with a value (e.g., the name of a variable or a mathematical expression, as opposed to an assignment with an equals sign), 
then R will show that value:

```{r surface_temperature}
T
```


We can also print the value of an R expression in the middle of a line of text using inline code: ` T = ` `r rinline("T")` will give T = `r T`.

Inline code is very useful because it lets us ask R to automatically insert a number into the text. This means that every time we
knit the document, that number is generated by R. If you write a report and then realize that there was a problem with the data
or the analysis, you can just fix the problem and re-knit the report using the corrected data and analysis code. You don't need to 
manually go through a separate document and edit the numbers to update them with the latest results from your analysis. RMarkdown
will do that for you, if you used inline code to insert the numbers into your text.

Thus, a bit of extra work at the beginning to set up the document and analysis using RMarkdown saves lots of time 
later on by making it trivial to update the document.

Code blocks also allow us to include graphs in our document:


<pre><code>```{r graph_example, fig.cap = "This is a plot of pressure versus temperature."}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Temperature", y = "Pressure")
```</code></pre>


```{r graph_example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "This is a plot of pressure versus temperature."}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Temperature", y = "Pressure")
```

## Loading R Scripts

In this course, I am trying to teach you to use the basics of R. Sometimes we will 
need to do things for our analysis that require more complicated R programming,
and then I will write R scripts that contain this code so you don't need to write
it yourself from scratch, but can just call functions that I provide.

To load a script (a file containing R code), you use the R command `source("script_file.R"")`

For the exercises here, we will use two scripts, which are located in the "scripts" directory.

To load them into R so you can use them in your analysis, you would put the following
code into your RMarkdown document:

```{r load_scripts}
source("scripts/format_md.R")
source("scripts/layer_diagram.R")
```

These scripts contain the code for a function, `format_md`, which formats numbers nicely for markdown documents, 
allowing you to control how many decimal places it shows, and optionally using scientific notation or inserting commas to separate thousands, millions, etc.

`format_md(sigma, digits = 1)` will produce `r format_md(sigma, digits = 1)`

`format_md(sigma, digits = 1, scientific = FALSE)` will produce `r format_md(sigma, digits = 1, scientific = FALSE)`

`format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE)` will produce `r format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE)`

`format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, comma = TRUE)` will produce `r format_md(pi * 1E6, digits = 3, scientific = FALSE, comma = TRUE)`


The other script allows you to produce a layer diagram, similar to the ones in Chapter 3 of _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

```{r example_layer_diagram}
make_layer_diagram(2)
```


# Using RMarkdown to do exercises from the textbook.

## Exercise 2.1

Consider exercise 1 in Chapter 2, on p. 17 of our textbook, _Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_:

> A joule (J) is an amount of energy, and a watt (W) is a rate of using energy, defined as 1 W = 1 J/s. How many Joules of energy are required to run a 100-W light bulb for one day?

```{r ex_1_1_a}
seconds_per_hour = 60 * 60 # number of seconds in one hour
hours_per_day = 24 # number of seconds in one day
light_bulb_power = 100
joules_per_day = light_bulb_power * seconds_per_hour * hours_per_day

joules_per_day
```

It can be hard to read a long number like that, so we can use R's format command to add commas:

```{r formatting_example}
format_md(joules_per_day, comma = TRUE)
```

A `r light_bulb_power` watt light bulb burns `r light_bulb_power` Joules per second, 
so the light bulb burns `r light_bulb_power * seconds_per_hour` Joules per hour and
`r joules_per_day` Joules per day.

> Burning coal yields about 30 &times; 10^6^ J of energy per kilogram of coal burned. Assuming that the coal power plant is 30% efficient,
> how much coal has to be burned to light that light bulb for one day?

```{r ex_1_1_b}
joules_heat_per_kg_coal = 30.E+6
efficiency = 0.30
joules_electricity_per_kg_coal = joules_heat_per_kg_coal * efficiency
kg_coal_per_joule_electricity = 1 / joules_electricity_per_kg_coal
kg_coal_per_day = joules_per_day * kg_coal_per_joule_electricity

kg_coal_per_day
```

1 kilogram of coal produces `r format_md(joules_heat_per_kg_coal, digits = 1)` joules of heat, which is converted into `r format_md(joules_electricity_per_kg_coal, digits = 1)` joules of electricity.
We can turn this around and figure that to get 1 joule of electricity takes 1 / (`r format_md(joules_electricity_per_kg_coal, digits = 1)`) = `r format_md(kg_coal_per_joule_electricity, digits = 1)` kg of coal,
so to get `r format_md(joules_per_day, digits = 1)` joules of electricity to power the light bulb for one day takes `r format_md(kg_coal_per_day, digits = 2)` kg of coal.

## Exercise 2.2

> A gallon of casoline carries with it about 1.3 &times; 10^8^ J of energy. Given a price of $3 per callon, how many Joules can you get for a dollar?

```{r ex_2_2_a}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
# 
```

> Electricity goes for about $0.05 per kilowatt hour. A kilowatt hour is just a 
> weird way to write Joules because a watt is a joule per second, and a kilowatt 
> hour is the number of Joules one would get from running 1000 W time one hour
> (3,600 seconds). In the form of electricity, how many Joules can you get for a 
> dollar?

```{r ex_2_2_b}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

> A standard cubic foot of natural gas carries with it about 1.1 &times; 10^6^ Joules
> of energy. You can get about 5 &times; 10^5^ British Thermal Units (BTUs) of gas
> for a dollar, and there are about 1,030 BTUs in a standard cubic foot. 
> How many Joules of energy in the form of natural gas can you get for a dollar?

```{r ex_2_2_c}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

> A ton of coal holds about 3.2 &times; 10^10^ J of energy and costs about $40.
> How many Joules of energy in the form of coal can you get for a dollar?

```{r ex_2_2_d}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

> Corn oil costs about $0.10 per fluid ounce wholesale. A fluid ounce carries
> about 240 dietary Calories (which a scientist would call kilocalories).
> A dietary Calorie is about 4200 J. How many Joules of energy in the form of
> corn oil can you get for a dollar?

```{r ex_2_2_e}
# Put your R code here to answer the question
```

> Rank these five energy sources from cheap to expensive. 
> What is the range of prices?
